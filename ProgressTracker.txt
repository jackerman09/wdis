SETUP HOME PAGE MATCHUP SHOWING

--- PRIORITY ---
- Update authentication so non-admins cannot access matchups or player/team[create, delete, edit]

----------------

- Add button to generate matchups (that don't already exist) for given player

- Work out weekly and total scoring calculations
- Show player's weekly scores on the players index in a table w/ opponent

- Update home page (js.coffee) so that the credit value doesn't show [OBJECT] briefly before loading the number (why is this even happening?)


 - Added updatepts.js.coffee and moved some coffeescript to it. Commented out the ajax success call in home.js.coffee so that it can run in the new file. ERB is working in the new file, but there keeps being an INDENTED error
