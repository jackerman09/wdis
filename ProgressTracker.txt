SETUP HOME PAGE MATCHUP SHOWING

--- PRIORITY ---
- Update authentication so non-admins cannot access matchups or player/team[create, delete, edit]

----------------

- After signin redirect_to root_path

- Add button to generate matchups (that don't already exist) for given player

- Add 'injured' field to player to remove them from matchup selection rotation

- Have home page load new matchup after voting based on weighted probability so that closer matchups come up more often - DECIDED NOT TO DO THIS
- Fix infinite loop on bye-week avoiding matchup selection

- Work out weekly and total scoring calculations
- Show player's weekly scores on the players index in a table w/ opponent

- Add @ for home/away to team/show and to full_matchup if team is away

- Update home page (js.coffee) so that the credit value doesn't show [OBJECT] briefly before loading the number (why is this even happening?)
